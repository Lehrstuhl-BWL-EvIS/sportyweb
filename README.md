# Sportyweb - Make managing sports clubs a breeze! 

We are currently initiating development of a web application for managing, organising and running amateur sports clubs. Amateur sports clubs range from small clubs with a handful of members to large clubs with several thousand members. We target amateur multi-sports clubs with a few hundred to several thousand members and a dedicated multi-person club management. Multi-sports clubs offer their members activities in different sports such as soccer, volleyball, tennis, fitness and track & field. Club management involves membership management, management of practices & courses, facilities & their availability, tournaments & leagues etc. in addition to finance & accounting and other administrative and organisational tasks. 

Join us in [discussing](https://github.com/sportyweb/sportyweb/wiki) the application domain of multi-sports clubs management with regard to software requirements (in German, though ðŸ˜‰).

Sportyweb is part of an academic research & development project at the ["Enterprise Modelling Research Group", University of Hagen, Germany](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/evis/forschung/projekte/sportyweb.shtml) and is developed as an open source software under Apache 2.0 license.

[Denken Sie mit uns](https://github.com/sportyweb/sportyweb/wiki) Ã¼ber eine freie integrierte webbasierte Anwendungssoftware fÃ¼r Amateursportvereine nach und machen Sie bei der Software-Entwicklung mit: Sportyweb soll die Vereins- und GeschÃ¤ftsfÃ¼hrung, Vereinsmitarbeiter und Vereinsmitglieder bei VereinsfÃ¼hrung, Vereinsmitwirkung und Vereinsteilhabe unterstÃ¼tzen â€“ in Amateursportvereinen mit Angeboten in mehreren Sportarten (Multisportvereine), mit mehreren Abteilungen (und Abteilungsebenen) und einer Vereins- und GeschÃ¤ftsfÃ¼hrung, die aus mehreren Personen in verschiedenen Rollen besteht.

Sportyweb ist eine Initiative der [Enterprise Modelling Research Group](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/evis/forschung/projekte/sportyweb.shtml) an der FernUniversitÃ¤t in Hagen. 

## Sportyweb - Run prototype

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Change the development database name (sportyweb_dev) if necessary in sportyweb/config/dev.exs
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## For collaborators (and students @ FUH) : How to prepare your machine for collaboration 

### For students @ FUH

  * You will receive an email invitation to join the Sportyweb project on GitLab as a project member in the role as Developer (sent by the project maintainers).  
  * Accept the invitation and, if not already done, create your GitLab account for your collaboration on the Sportyweb project, and log in to GitLab to adjust your profile and settings.
  * Verify that you are assigned to the sportyweb project on GitLab and your role is 'Developer'.
  * Take a look at the main and the development branches in the repository.
  * Read these instructions carefully and set up your machine for collaboration.

### Prerequisites

  * You will need a current version of 
  ** git (we currently use 2.37.2) 
  ** gpg (GnuPG, we currently use 2.3.7)
  ** Erlang (as of today we use: Erlang 25.0.4)
  ** Elixir (as of today we use: Elixir 1.13.4)
  ** PostgreSQL >=13 (as of today, we use: PostgreSQL 14)
  * We also recommend to use:
  ** Visual Studio Code (as IDE and code editor, install the vscode-elixir extension and other you like)

### Preparation instructions  

  * If you run 
    * macOS (we are currently on Monterey 12.5.1), install Homebrew: https://brew.sh and possibly asdf: https://asdf-vm.com (read the instructions before deciding on asdf)
    * if you run Windows, we have no recommendation / experience as of now (i.e. search the web and let us know what you recommend to others)
    * if you run Linux, most of the following instructions should work accordingly (let us know what you recommend to others)
  * Install Erlang >=25  - on MacOS you may use HomeBrew: `brew install erlang latest` 
  * Install Elixir >=1.13 (as of today: 1.13.4) - on MacOS you may use HomeBrew: `brew install elixir latest`
  * Install PostgreSQL >=13 () - on MacOS you may use HomeBrew: `brew install elixir latest`
  * Make sure both Elixir and Erlang are accessible from your $PATH (which HomeBrew usually takes care of)
  * Create a folder / directory in which your local Git repository will live and cd into this folder
  * Clone the Sportyweb GitLab repository:  `git clone https://gitlab.com/fuhevis/sportyweb.git`  
  * Run PostgreSQL: Open a terminal and start your PostgreSQL server (in non-daemon mode / not as a background process). On macOS run `brew info postgresql` to find out how to start your PostgreSQL instance. On our M1 mac, we use `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgres` and leave the terminal open to run the database server instance while developing.
  * Follow the instructions (above) to test run the prototype: 
    * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
    * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
    * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
    * Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to see the Phoenix default start page
