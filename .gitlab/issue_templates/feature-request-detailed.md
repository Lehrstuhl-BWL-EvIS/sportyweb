<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: The following template is taken from the GitLab developmentworkflow itself at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates -->

<!-- This issue template can be used as a great starting point for feature requests. The section "Feature Description / Future Release notes" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.

The goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). -->

### Feature description / Future Release Notes

<!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases).
